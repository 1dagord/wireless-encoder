# Wireless Encoder

When communicating wirelessly, there are a handful of challenges present that are not applicable to traditional communication over a wire. These challenges include:

- Bit Power Allocation
- Thermal/Shot Noise
- Synchronization
- Inter-Symbol Interference

These challenges can both compromise the fidelity of the signal and hinder the speed of communication.
